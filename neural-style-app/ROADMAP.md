# Neural Style Transfer App Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the complete process to build a hosted neural style transfer application from scratch. The app will feature a frontend (Angular) for uploading images and displaying results, a backend (Flask/Python) for processing with TensorFlow, and hosting on Railway (backend) and Vercel (frontend). We'll reuse the high-quality ML logic from the Jupyter notebook.

As a beginner, we'll take this step-by-step with clear milestones. Each milestone includes estimated time, prerequisites, and deliverables. Track progress by checking off completed items.

## Prerequisites (Before Starting)
- Basic understanding of HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for frontend).
- Windows computer with internet access.
- Install Node.js (for Angular) and Python (for backend) from their official websites.
- GitHub account (for hosting deployments).
- Patience—each step is explained in detail.

## Phase 1: Setup and Planning (1-2 Hours)
**Milestone 1.1: Project Structure Setup** ✅ Completed
- Create a new project folder (e.g., `neural-style-app`).
- Set up subfolders: `backend/` and `frontend/`.
- Initialize Git repository: `git init`.
- Deliverable: Folder structure ready.

**Milestone 1.2: Install Tools** ✅ Completed
- Install Node.js and npm.
- Install Python 3.8+.
- Verify installations with `node -v`, `npm -v`, `python --version`.
- Deliverable: Tools installed and verified.

## Phase 2: Backend Development (4-6 Hours)
**Milestone 2.1: Python Environment Setup** ✅ Completed
- Create virtual environment: `python -m venv backend/neural_venv`.
- Activate: `backend/neural_venv/Scripts/activate` (Windows).
- Install packages: `pip install flask tensorflow tensorflow-hub pillow numpy opencv-python`.
- Deliverable: Virtual environment with dependencies.

**Milestone 2.2: Basic Flask App** ✅ Completed
- Create `backend/app.py` with a simple "Hello World" endpoint.
- Run locally: `python app.py`.
- Test with browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
- Deliverable: Running Flask server.

**Milestone 2.3: Integrate ML Logic** ✅ Completed
- Copy style transfer code from Jupyter notebook into `backend/app.py`.
- Add `/stylize` endpoint to accept image uploads and return stylized image.
- Test with sample images (e.g., dog.jpg and starry_night.jpg).
- Deliverable: Endpoint processes images and returns results.

**Milestone 2.4: Error Handling and Optimization** ✅ Completed
- Add try/catch for errors, file validation.
- Optimize for speed (e.g., resize images if needed).
- Deliverable: Robust backend ready for integration.

## Phase 3: Frontend Development (3-5 Hours)
**Milestone 3.1: Angular Setup** ✅ Completed
- In `frontend/`, run `npx @angular/cli new frontend --routing --style=css`.
- Navigate to `frontend/` and run `npm install`.
- Start dev server: `ng serve`.
- Deliverable: Basic Angular app running at `http://localhost:4200`.

**Milestone 3.2: UI Components** ✅ Completed
- Create upload forms for content and style images.
- Add a button to trigger stylization.
- Display result image.
- Deliverable: Functional UI with placeholders.

**Milestone 3.3: API Integration** ✅ Completed
- Install Angular HttpClient: `npm install @angular/common/http`.
- Modify component to send POST requests to backend API.
- Handle responses and display stylized image.
- Deliverable: Frontend calls backend and shows results.

## Phase 4: Integration and Testing (2-3 Hours)
**Milestone 4.1: Local Integration** ✅ Completed
- Run backend and frontend simultaneously.
- Upload images and verify end-to-end flow.
- Test with different image sizes.
- Deliverable: App works locally.

**Milestone 4.2: Debugging and Polish** ✅ Completed
- Fix any CORS or upload issues.
- Add loading indicators and error messages.
- Ensure responsive design.
- Deliverable: Polished local app.

## Phase 5: Hosting and Deployment (2-4 Hours)
**Milestone 5.1: Backend Hosting (Railway)**
- Create Railway account and connect GitHub repo.
- Deploy backend from GitHub (Railway auto-detects Flask).
- Deliverable: Backend live on Railway (e.g., `https://your-app.up.railway.app`).

**Milestone 5.2: Frontend Hosting (Vercel)**
- Build Angular: `ng build --prod`.
- Create Vercel account, connect GitHub repo.
- Deploy from `dist/` folder.
- Update API calls to Railway URL.
- Deliverable: Frontend live on Vercel.

**Milestone 5.3: Final Testing**
- Test hosted app with real images.
- Verify quality matches Jupyter notebook.
- Share link for portfolio.
- Deliverable: Fully hosted app.

## Total Estimated Time: 12-20 Hours
- Spread over 1-2 weeks to avoid burnout.
- Each milestone is self-contained—stop and resume anytime.
- If stuck, ask for help on specific milestones.

## Tips for Success
- Follow milestones sequentially.
- Use VS Code for editing.
- Backup code with Git commits after each milestone.
- Resources: Official docs for Flask, Angular, Railway, Vercel.
- If issues arise, provide error messages for targeted help.
